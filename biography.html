					<h2> About The Man </h2>
					<p>
						Chancelor Johnathan Bennett (born April 16, 1993), known professionally as Chance the Rapper, is an American rapper, singer, 
						songwriter, record producer, and actor from the West Chatham neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. In 2013, he began to gain 
						recognition following the release of his second mixtape, Acid Rap. Apart from his solo career, he is also a member of the 
						Chicago collective Save Money (along with frequent collaborator Vic Mensa), and has worked as the lead vocalist for the band 
						The Social Experiment. They released the widely lauded album Surf in May 2015.
					</p>
					<p>
						In May 2016, Bennett released the mixtape Coloring Book to further critical acclaim. This is Bennett's third mixtape, which
						earned him three Grammy awards, including Best Rap Album. Coloring Book was the first streaming-only album to ever receive a
						Grammy nomination.

					<h3> Early Life </h3>
					<p>	
						Chance the Rapper grew up in the middle-class neighborhood of West Chatham on Chicago's South Side. His younger brother, 
						Taylor Bennett, is also a Chicago rapper. His father, Ken Williams-Bennett, was an aide to former Chicago mayor Harold 
						Washington and worked for then-Senator Barack Obama. Williams-Bennett, who is now a deputy chief of staff to Mayor Rahm Emanuel,
						dreamed that his son might one day hold office. In his freshman year at Jones College Prep High School, Chance formed the
						hip-hop duo Instrumentality with a friend. Many of Chance's earliest performances took place at the YOUmedia Lyricist Loft at
						Harold Washington Library in Chicago. He mentioned in an interview that fellow Chicago native Kanye West's 2004 debut album 
						The College Dropout was the first hip-hop album that he ever purchased and listened to, previously being into soul and jazz.
					</p>

						At Jones College Prep High School, some of his teachers ridiculed his aspirations to become a musician. Following a 10-day
						suspension in early 2011 during his senior year for possessing marijuana on campus, Bennett recorded his first full-length 
						project, a mixtape titled 10 Day (also known as #10Day). In December 2011, he released a song titled "Windows", and
						publicly announced his 10 Day project. In February 2012, Bennett was highlighted as one of Complex magazine's "10 New Chicago
						Rappers to Watch Out For." Bennett says he spent "about eight months recording, writing and making connections off of the 
						to put out something." Bennett released the mixtape on April 3, 2012 and it has since been downloaded over 300,000 times via
						Datpiff. The mixtape was well received locally and helped Bennett make connections with producers such as Chuck Inglish,
						Kenny Jame$, and Blended Babies. The mixtape grabbed the attention of Forbes magazine, which featured it in the publication's 
						Cheap Tunes column. Prior to writing and recording 10 Day, Chance The Rapper recorded the mixtape "Good Enough" and "The Back 
						to School Pack EP."
